## Features

- **Smooth Animations:** Customizable animation duration and swipe thresholds for a fluid experience.
- **Gesture Support:** Easily open/close the drawer with horizontal drag gestures.
- **Resizable Desktop Drawer:** Drag the divider on desktop to resize the drawer within defined minimum and maximum widths.
- **Custom Callbacks:** Execute actions when the drawer animation completes.

void main() {
  runApp(const MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Sliding Drawer Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue, useMaterial3: true),
      home: const HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}

class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  const HomeScreen({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return SlidingDrawer(
      drawer: const DrawerContent(),
      body: const MainContent(),
    );
  }
}

class DrawerContent extends StatelessWidget {
  const DrawerContent({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Wrap the entire drawer content in a Material widget.
    return Material(
      child: Container(
        color: Colors.blueGrey[100],
        child: ListView(
          children: [
            DrawerHeader(
              decoration: const BoxDecoration(color: Colors.blue),
              child: Text(
                'Drawer Header',
                style: Theme.of(
                  context,
                ).textTheme.titleLarge?.copyWith(color: Colors.white),
              ),
            ),
            ListTile(
              leading: const Icon(Icons.home),
              title: const Text('Home'),
              onTap: () {
              },
            ),
            ListTile(
              leading: const Icon(Icons.settings),
              title: const Text('Settings'),
              onTap: () {
              },
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class MainContent extends StatelessWidget {
  const MainContent({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: const Text('Sliding Drawer Example')),
      body: const Center(
        child: Text('Swipe right from the left edge to open the drawer'),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Customization Options

When creating a `SlidingDrawer`, you can customize its behavior and appearance using the following parameters:

- **`animationDuration`**: The duration of the open/close animation.
- **`openRatio`**: The fraction of the screen width that the drawer covers when fully open on mobile.
- **`desktopOpenRatio`**: The fraction of the screen width for the open drawer on desktop devices.
- **`desktopMinDrawerWidth`** & **`desktopMaxDrawerWidth`**: The minimum and maximum widths allowed for the drawer on desktop devices.
- **`swipeVelocityThreshold`**: The minimum swipe velocity required to trigger the open/close action.
- **`dragPercentageThreshold`**: The drag percentage needed to complete an open/close action if the swipe velocity is low.
- **`onAnimationComplete`**: A callback function that is called once the drawer has finished animating.
- **`dividerWidth`**: The width of the draggable divider between the drawer and the body on desktop devices.
- **`centerDivider`**: A boolean that determines whether the divider is centered along the edge of the open drawer.
- **`controller`**: An optional `SlidingDrawerController` that allows you to programmatically open, close, or toggle the drawer.
