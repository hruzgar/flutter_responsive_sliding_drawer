## 1.0.0

Working release. All functionality is implemented and is working on Android and Windows platforms without bugs.

## 1.1.0

Changed behavior on desktop so that the main window does not get cut off from the right and resizes itself.

## 1.2.0

Added parameters for divider width and center placement of divider on desktop. Also removed unnecessary code for mobile and refactored codebase. With this I think the codebase is pretty stable, good designed etc. I don't know if I will update this at all in the future (because it's perfect already).

## 1.2.1 

Fixed small centerDivider parameter bug.
